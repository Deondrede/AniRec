## Setup
1. Clone the repository and download [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (You will also need to enable virtualization on your CPU, how to do this is specific to what kind of motherboard your PC uses along with what kind of CPU, older models of CPU's do not support virtualizaion)
2. Once Docker is installed open your terminal and change directories to where you cloned the repository
3. Once there, run the command `docker-compose up`, this will run the local web server along with the database and it should now appear in the desktop program
